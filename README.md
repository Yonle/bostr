# Bostr
A nostr relay bouncer.

## What is this?
**Bostr** is a multi nostr relay **proxy** that were serving as a nostr relay.

## Why?
Nostr relays is a bunch of dummy servers that store user events. Normally nostr clients usually connects to more than 5-10 relays to receive and transmit events.

Due to it's nature that connects to more than just a single relay, **Client bandwidth usage is high.** And because of this, Nostr bandwidth usage is not really recommended for some users, notably **mobile data users.**

This project solve the problem by **reducing** the number of connected relays, at the same time **proxying** multiple relays in a single socket to nostr client.

## Running
```
node index.js
```

Or run in background with `tmux`:

```
tmux new -d "node index.js"
```

## Environment Variable
- `CLUSTERS` - Run Bostr with specified numbers of clusters.
- `LOG_ABOUT_RELAYS` - Whenever to log about relay connections

## Docker
### Quick Run
```
git clone https://github.com/Yonle/bostr
cd bostr
docker build -t bostr:local .
docker run --rm --name bostr -p 8080:8080 -v ./config.js:/usr/src/app/config.js bostr:local
