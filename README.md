# Bostr
A nostr relay bouncer.

## What is this?
**Bostr** is an nostr relay aggregator **proxy** that acts like a regular nostr relay. It connects to multiple configured relays to exchange data (events). This project purpose is saving mobile user's bandwidth when using nostr and to help decentralization.

## Why?
Nostr relays is a bunch of dummy servers that store user events. Normally nostr clients connects to more than 5-10 relays to receive and transmit events.

Due to it's nature that connects to more than just a single relay, It's transmitting and retrieving the same event across relays over and over, Which then makes the **client bandwidth usage to be high.** And because of this, Nostr bandwidth usage is not really recommended for some users, notably **mobile data users.**

This project solve the problem by **proxying** multiple relays in a single socket while **not forwarding the same event** to the client.

## How it works?
![How it works](img/how_it_works.png)

In order to make this work properly, A nostr client should only connect to a single bostr relay.

## Installation
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (v18 or up)
- A fast internet connection

You could set up an bostr bouncer by installing [Bostr CLI](#bostr-cli), or setting up via [The Source Code](#source-code), or via [Docker](#docker).

**Tip:** When dependencies installation is failed due to failed compilation of `bufferutil` or `utf-8-validate` packages, Run `npm install` with `--omit=optional` (Example: `npm install --omit=optional -g bostr`).

### Bostr CLI
Install bostr via `npm`:
```
npm install -g bostr
```

or via git:

```
npm install -g https://github.com/Yonle/bostr.git
```

You will need to make config with the following command:
```
bostr makeconf bostr_config.js
```

Edit `bostr_config.js` (Could be modified) with your file editor and fill some required fields accordingly to your needs. You could run it for everyone or only for yourself.

#### Running
After you finished editing the config file, You could start bostr with the following command:
```
bostr start bostr_config.js
```

Or run in background with `tmux`:

```
tmux new -d "bostr start bostr_config.js"
```

When configuring reverse proxy, Ensure that `x-forwarded-proto` header was set as `https`.

### Source code

```
git clone -b stable https://github.com/Yonle/bostr
cd bostr
npm install
```

Rename `config.js.example` as `config.js`, Start editing the file and fill some required fields accordingly to your needs. You could run it for everyone or only for yourself.

#### Running
```
node index.js
```

Or run in background with `tmux`:

```
tmux new -d "node index.js"
```

When configuring reverse proxy, Ensure that `x-forwarded-proto` header was set as `https`.

### Docker
```
git clone https://github.com/Yonle/bostr
cd bostr
cp config.js.example config.js
```

You will need to edit `config.js` before running the bouncer.

Then, you will need to edit `compose.yaml` to override the forwarded port to match with the one in `config.js`.

#### Running
```
docker build -t bostr:local .
docker run --rm --name bostr -p 8080:8080 -v ./config.js:/usr/src/app/config.js bostr:local
```

## Environment Variables
You could specify the following environment variables to override the current settings:

- `CLUSTERS` - Run Bostr with specified numbers of clusters.
- `LOG_ABOUT_RELAYS` - Whenever to log about relay connections.
